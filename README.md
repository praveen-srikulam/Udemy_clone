ðŸŽ“ Udemy Clone Website
This is a simple Udemy Clone website built using HTML and CSS. I created this project to practice building the layout of a real-world website and to improve my frontend development skills.

ðŸ”§ What I Used
HTML for the page structure

CSS for styling and layout

ðŸ“„ Features
Header with logo, search bar, and navigation links

Course sections with thumbnails and titles (like the Udemy homepage)

Responsive layout (basic)

This project is only for learning purposes and is not connected to the real Udemy website. I'm still learning and will keep improving it as I grow!
